1.2.0
  - *removed*: x84.bbs.log.ColoredConsoleHandler.
    If you see exception: ``ImportError: No module named log``
    simply change line, ``class = x84.bbs.log.ColoredConsoleHandler``
    to new line, ``class = logging.StreamHandler``
    in your ~/.x84/logging.ini or /etc/x84/logging.ini file!
  - new bulletins, userlist, from hellbeard
  - new door 'sesame.py' script, from maze
  - project 'blessed' has been merged. Some minor API changes that
    currently just emit a DeprecationWarning, will be removed in 2.0,
    especially in regards to sequence-safe textwrap() function, one
    should instead use term.wrap().
  - project 'wcwidth' has been merged. No change.
  - move_x now works for screen/etc. TERM types (fixed in blessed).

1.0.9
  - tagging no longer requires 'moderator' or 'sysop' group by default,
    is now configurable with .ini options of section [msg]:
    moderated_tags: yes/no, tag_moderators: list of groups
  - yet even more fixes for bad xml bytes in bbs-scene.org's onelinerz api
  - thanks to xzip, weather now looks like a television broadcast layout.

1.0.8
  - UI/bugfixes for last callers (default/lc.py) and default/ttyplay.py
1.0.6, 1.0.7
  - various issues with SyncTerm client resolved in bbs/editor.py and
    default/editor.py, notably: don't draw on bottom line (causes scroll),
    and use 'term.normal' before 'term.red_reverse' or other 'highlight'
    colors, which were otherwise rendered invisible by SyncTerm.
  - some timing negotiations lengthened for very-high latency links, and
    dec vt query removed, it was found useless, increasing connect-time.
1.0.5
  - please add/merge in new 'default.ini' and 'logging.ini' values.
    You can move away your old files, start x84, then compare. There are
    new sections such as [lord], [dosemu], and [door].
  - last callers database must be rebuilt for migrations, this is the default
    "debug" door for sysops, press ctrl + _ from the main menu to rebuild.
    otherwise only new callers will appear.
  - otherwise, this new release includes general display and bug fixes and
    door support for LORD/dosemu, bbs/door.py and default/lord.py.
