Install instructions
====================

1. Install python_ 2.6 or 2.7

2. Install pip_

3. Ensure pip is up-to-date::

     pip install --upgrade pip

4. Install x/84::

     pip install x84

5. Upgrading::

     pip install --upgrade x84

Getting Started
---------------

1. Launch the *x84.engine* python module::

     x84

   *x84* is a ``/bin/sh`` wrapper for launching *python -m x84.engine*.
   If the ``*x84`` helper script fails, try using the python interpreter
   used with ``pip``, for example::

     /usr/local/bin/python2.7 -m x84.engine


2. Telnet to 127.0.0.1 6023, Assuming a *bsd telnet* client::

     telnet localhost 6023


x84 Usage
---------

Optional command line arguments,

   ``--config=`` alternate bbs configuration filepath

   ``--logger=`` alternate logging configuration filepath

UCS4 Support
------------

If you receive this error::

  warn    engine.py:95  - Python not built with wide unicode support!

And you are concerned with very large unicode points, such as used in Thai or emoticons like hamsterface, üêπ, you will need to upgrade or rebuild your python interpreter so that it is build with *UCS4* support. Otherwise it may only be displayed, but input characters will often be decoded as '??'.
