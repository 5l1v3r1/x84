   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to x84 BBS's documentation!
===================================

x/84 is a python-languaged telnet daemon for modern utf8 terminals. Based on
miniboa_, blessings_, sqlitedict_, and multiprocessing_. recordings of sessions
are stored in ttyplay_-compatible format files. IBM Codepage 437 to UTF8
helpers are used to translate "ansi art" (such as you would find on the ACiD
"dark domains" DVD) to modern terminals.

A default 'bbs board' is provided in style of renegade, ami/x. This provides
some doors for bbs-scene_.org API's such as 'one liners' and 'bbs listers', a
telnet-out gateway that translates CP437 to UTF8, messaging, supports example
doors dopewars_ and nethack_.

*x/84 is still in development, we welcome any patches and contributions.*
