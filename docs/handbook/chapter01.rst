Chapter 1: Introduction to x/84 telnet system
=============================================


Before you get started
======================

The x/84 telnet system is written in the Python_ programming language. With
prior programming experience you should be able to pick up the language quickly
by looking at the provided sample mods in the ``x84/default`` folder. If you
are completely new to Python_, it's recommended to read more about the
language, like provided by the free `Dive Into Python`_ book by Mark Pilgrim.
