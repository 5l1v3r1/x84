Requirements
===================

A Posix operating system is required, generally something unix-derived.  Alternative implementations of python may work. 

Windows operating systems may not work because of the dependency on curses and a termcap library for detecting terminal capabilities.  A cygwin-based build *may* cope fine, but is untested.

UCS4 Support
````````````

If you receive this error::

  warn    engine.py:95  - Python not built with wide unicode support!

And you are concerned with very large unicode points, such as used in Thai or emoticons like hamsterface, üêπ, you will need to upgrade or rebuild your python interpreter so that it is build with *UCS4* support.  Otherwise it may only be displayed, but input characters will often be decoded as '??'.

Python requirements
```````````````````

1. Install python_ 2.6 or 2.7

2. Install pip_

3. Ensure pip is up-to-date::

     pip install --upgrade pip

Installing
==========

Install using pip::

     pip install x84


Upgrading
---------
Upgrade using::

     pip install --upgrade x84

Blowfish
````````

Blowfish encryption of user account passwords is *recommended*, but requires a C compiler to install the dependent module, *py-bcrypt*, thereby reducing the portability.  This will significantly reduce password encryption time on slower systems.

To enable, set ``default.ini`` file option *password_digest* of section *[system]* to *bcrypt* and install py-bcrypt::

  pip install py-bcrypt

Otherwise, a best-effort sha256 hash is implemented by default. 


Getting Started
===============

1. Launch the *x84.engine* python module::

     x84

   *x84* is a ``/bin/sh`` wrapper for launching *python -m x84.engine*.
   If the *x84* helper script fails, try using the python interpreter
   used with *pip*, for example::

     /usr/local/bin/python2.7 -m x84.engine

2. Telnet to 127.0.0.1 6023, Assuming a *bsd telnet* client::

     telnet localhost 6023

x84 Usage
`````````

Optional command line arguments,

   ``--config=`` alternate bbs configuration filepath

   ``--logger=`` alternate logging configuration filepath
