Developer Environment
`````````````````````

For developing from git, simply clone and execute the ./x84/bin/dev-setup python script with the target interpreter, specifying a ``virtual env`` folder. Source the ``*virtual env*/bin/activate`` file so that subsequent *pip* commands affect only that specific environment. Target environment for x/84 is currently python 2.7.

1. Clone the github repository::

     git clone 'https://github.com/jquast/x84.git'``

2. Use ``dev-setup.py`` to create a target virtualenv (virtualenv provided)::

     python2.7 ./x84/bin/dev-setup.py ./x84-ENV26

3. Launch x/84 using virtualenv::

     ./x84/bin/x84-dev
