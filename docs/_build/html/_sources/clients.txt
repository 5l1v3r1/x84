Compatible Clients
``````````````````

Any UTF-8 client is compatible. For Apple systems, *Andale Mono* works wonderfully. When using BSD telnet, use command line argument ``-L`` to enable *BINARY* 8-bit mode for utf-8 input.

Other utf-8 terminals:

* PuTTy: Under preference item *Window -> Translation*, option *Remote character set*, change *iso8859-1* to *UTF-8*.
* iTerm: Menu item *iTerm -> Preferences*, section *Profiles*, select tab *Text*, chose *Andale Mono* font.
* Terminal.app: Menu item *Terminal -> Preferences*, chose profile *Pro*, select Font *Andale Mono*, and enable *use bright colors for bold text*.
* uxterm or other utf-8 rxvt and xterm variants: urxvt, dtterm.

Other than UTF-8, only IBM CP437 encoding is supported. Any 8-bit telnet client with CP437 font is supported.

Examples of these include PuTTy, SyncTerm, mtel, netrunner, linux/bsd console + bsd telnet.

Some non-DOS terminal emulators may require installing a fontset, such as *Terminus_* to provide CP437 art.
