Introduction
=============

This software is in development, and we encourage feedback and contributions.

This software is written in Python. It requires Python to run. Additionaly,
the telnet and ssh features are provided through the python twisted framework.
Finally, the ZODB package, an independant portion of the Zope software suite
is necessary for the BBS system data.

Requirements
=============

The system requires:
   Python 2.5
   ZODB 3-3.3 or newer
   Twisted framework

ZODB is not often found in distribution systems unbundled from zope, however
zope is not required. ZODB can be installed independantly from source, using
file ZODB3-3.4.2.tgz or newer.

Only the telnet portion of the twisted framework is required.
The ssh portion of twisted, twisted-conch, is optional.

OpenBSD
========

 The following packages from ports are required:
   py-twisted-conch
   py-zopeinterface
   py-openssl
   py-crypto

NetBSD
=======

 The following packages from pkgsrc are required:
   py-twisted
   py-amkCrypto
   py-ZopeInterface
   ZODB3

Debian
=======

 For lenny, the following packages are required:
   python
   python-dev
   python-twisted-core
   python-setuptools

 And to install ZODB3, you need to run:
   easy_install ZODB3

 For etch, the default Python 2.5 doesn't support ZODB, so you should 
 use Python 2.4. The following packages are required:
   python2.4
   python-twisted-core
   python-zodb

 For incoming SSH, you need the package:
   python-twisted-conch

Ubuntu
=======

 Follow the instructions above for "Debian etch".

Mac OSX
========

 Using the MacPorts framework avaialble at http://www.macports.org/
 ensure the following ports are installed:
   py-zopeinterface
   py-twisted
   py-zodb

 * Note:

   You must use the python made available through ports, at location:
     /opt/local/bin/python

   and not the system distributed python made available at location:
     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python

   use the which(1) command to see which python is being used, and modify
   the path apropriately to ensure the ports-based python is at a higher
   priority in the search $PATH, for example:
     export PATH="/opt/local/bin:$PATH"
     sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/python2.4 /opt/local/bin/python
     sudo ln -s /optlocal/bin/pydoc2.4 /opt/local/bin/pydoc

   this should be placed in any apropriate startup script, and may be done
   for you by the macports installation.

Windows
========

 This software has been known to run in windows natively, provided the python
 software and the above described modules are available. However, some
 minor modifications to the kernel may be necessary, and the installation
 may be more involved.


Getting Started
================

To start the system, execute main.py through the python interpreter. The 
process does NOT daemonized, and debug messages can be viewed on stdout.

For unix systems, you may use the .sh scripts provided to assist in background
startups and rapid teardown and startup of the bbs system as an unprivledged
account. All of these scripts require the 'dtach' package. These scripts
are optional and are provided only for administration and rapid or remote
development:

   startup.sh  - for use in rc.d scripts
   attach.sh   - to attach to bbs, or run interactively
   restart.sh  - to force restart of the bbs system
   destroy.sh  - to force kill the bbs system

A successfull run of the bulletin board should apear as this:

+ PYTHON=/usr/pkg/bin/python
+ BBSPATH=/usr/local/src/bbs
+ BBSUSER=bbs
+ cd /tmp/bbs
+ sudo su bbs -c /usr/pkg/bin/python /usr/local/src//bbs/main.py
+ [telnet] Listening on port 1945
+ [SSH] Generating new host key. This may take a while.
+ [SSH] New host key generated.

then, telnet to the described telnet port. If you recieve errors regarding
import, you are missing a zodb or twisted package. Once the BBS is up, create
the sysop account by logging in and typing 'new' at the login prompt:

connectMade, init send
- New Session started.
[unknown]: matrix ()
[unknown]: /nua ('',)
userbase: first new user, 'head boss' becomes sysop.
[unknown]: //top ('head boss',)

Change the telnet and ssh port using default.py

Documentation
==============

Please refer to the inline documentation for developer assistance. You may use
the pydoc program to extract manual pages from code, or use the latest snapshot
documentation, available online at:
