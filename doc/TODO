* Fully cross-referenced api documentation

ftp support

nntp support

zmodem support

script/comment.py:
 - un-suck

sauce.py:
 - inherit File class, do magic on open, and add additional .sauce properties

script/ui/lightwin.py:
 - add search feature into lightwin?

strutils.py:
 - change all string[p]; p += 1 type code for ansi detection with regular expressions

fileutils.py:
 - more file archiver support. I think a 3rd party .rar module exists

terminal.py

 - a flag to disable color, which preprocesses output for color sequences
   and quietly snuffs them 

script/ue.py:
 - user editor: overhall

script/fb.py:
 - overhaul
 - allow database 'tagging' of files.
 - Sauce editor, intuitive saucing of mutliple files, like iTunes id3 editor?
   would require alot of hacking of the lightbar (selection_s_ array??)
 - '>' next and '<' previous in pager, bind to/inhereit lightbar?
 - display FILE_ID.DIZ's to the side while browsing?

script/dtdf.py:
script/text/dfeustel.txt
 - Deep thoughts by Dave Feustel. Google this guy, make a collection of all
   his looney technical posts, and put them on random, one per day or something

script/ui/menu.py:
     # make new menu
     menu(paraclass)
     # add choices
     choices['c'] = "chat"
     # update and refresh menu
     menu.update(choices)
  - a simple menu class that display's a user menu using
    a readonly paraclass and a high split value by default.
! + menu class takes user input, and listens to broadcast messages
    such as chat invination or new mail and calls gosubs()!
  - get user input like:
     choice = menu.run()

ISSUES:

 - attaching to other sessions may sometimes cause zombie threads and
   instability. this is getting very good, but still problems and
   race conditions can sometimes occur. No matter what, a user should
   be left with a working terminal, even if it isn't their own :D

 - Cannot ^C when a persistent session exists anywhere. Something is blocking!
