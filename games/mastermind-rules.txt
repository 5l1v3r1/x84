Mastermind is a game of deductive reasoning.  You play the role of a codebreaker.

Your task is to crack an unknown code within a limited set of turns.  Each turn, you may select combinations for each pin using the arrow keys. To make a break-in attempt, press return.

After each turn, a series of markers may appear, indicating a correct combination for one or more pin. The markers are hints as to how the combination lines up.

[31;1m*[m  a gear turned: correct color in correct position.
[37;1mo[m  a clicked tumbler: correct color in wrong position.

Good luck, comrade!
