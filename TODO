ROADMAP, 1.0:
EASY
* sysop's door to launch ttyplay -p on live terminals
* lolcat-like xterm-256color rainbow effect to demo colors
* local.py -- telnetlib to self :-)
* cleanup default/
* cleanup bbs/
* PEP-8 clean
* revise pydoc / docstrings
* script/ui/menu.py:
      # make new menu
      menu(paraclass)
      # add choices
      choices['c'] = "chat"
      # update and refresh menu
      menu.update(choices)
   - a simple menu class that display's a user menu using
     a readonly paraclass and a high split value by default.
 ! + menu class takes user input, and listens to broadcast messages
     such as chat invination or new mail and calls gosubs()!
   - get user input like:
      choice = menu.run()
* cross-session paging -- basically allow sending
  a script name + arguments to antoher session, forcing
  that session to gosub() -- this would be used, for instance
  by a sysop to break into chat,
  or to request chat by another user,
  or simply for fun
* user editor + profile editor (edit self)
* create wiki articles:
  - custom matrix
  - simple door game
* TERM=unknown -- this should create an 'expert mode' bbs, with
  no frills, no lightbars, no artwork, etc. -- for low bandwidth
  terminals.
* (cheap) message editor
  simply use horizontal line editor, when you press return, it moves
  to the next one... up arrows move to the previous one...
* find a unicode editor -- modify nvi ??
    nvi -S .... nvi still lets you :r /etc/passwd,
    and virus doesn't support unicode ..
* demonstrate xmodem protocol ...
  allow upload of .plan file
  allow download of bbs source code .
* clients acquire and release named locks, w/timeout
  like for dosemu autoexec.bat doors, etc.
* something wrong with pipe.send() in getpos()
* also snuff getpos() queries from ttyrec !
* properly implement STATUS in telnet.py ;/
* also TFLOW and TSPEED
* properly send GA when SGA is not negotiated
HARD
* message reader/browser
  something akin to mutt's interface would be super.
* bbs-scene.org bbs lister
* demonstrate LORD dosemu game, esp. cp437 art translation!
PARKING LOT

flesh out fileserver ... zIPE's call.
  at least hook on_* methods
  file stats, ftpd admin door, etc.

19:34  airwalk you need 1) gl like ftp support
19:34  airwalk and 2) zipscript-c support


must be compatible with the following clients,
(or document any changes required, fonts, etc.):
OSX:
   iTerm2
   Terminal.app
Windows:
   PuTTy
   SyncTerm
   mtel
   telnet (-t vtnt?)
BSD, Linux, etc.
   uxterm + bsdtelnet
