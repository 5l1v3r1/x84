ROADMAP, 1.0:

TESTING
* ensure you can have a login name of [some-japanese-characters]
* TERM=unknown -- this should create an 'expert mode' bbs, with
  no frills, no lightbars, no artwork, etc. -- for low bandwidth
  terminals.
* assert that any line that y and x, yloc, xloc, ypos, xpos, row, col
  are used, that they appear in order of Y, X.

must be compatible with the following clients,
(or document any changes required, fonts, etc.):
OSX:
   iTerm2
   Terminal.app
Windows:
   PuTTy
   SyncTerm
   mtel
   telnet (-t vtnt?)
BSD, Linux, etc.
   uxterm + bsdtelnet

SOON
* cross-session paging -- basically allow sending
  a script name + arguments to antoher session, forcing
  that session to gosub() -- this would be used, for instance
  by a sysop to break into chat,
  or to request chat by another user,
  or simply for fun; use term.exit_fullscreen;

DOCS
* create wiki articles:
  - custom matrix
  - simple door game

EASY
* properly send GA when SGA is not negotiated
* email password reset to new random gibberish
* sysop's door to launch ttyplay -p on live terminals
* local.py; wrap default/telnet.py / -- telnetlib to self :-)
* pylint-complete default/
* user editor + profile editor (edit self)
* (cheap) vertical message editor; simply use horizontal line editor,
  when you press return, it moves to the next one... up arrows move
  to the previous one... cheap.
* find a unicode editor -- modify nvi ??
    nvi -S .... nvi still lets you :r /etc/passwd,
    and virus doesn't support unicode ..
* demonstrate xmodem protocol ...
  allow upload/download of .plan file;
  allow download of bbs source code .

HARD
* setup.py creates us an 'x84' binary that 'just works',
* github integration, + repositories, notifications of commits .. ?
* properly implement STATUS in telnet.py ;/
* graffiti app example, a simple ansi editor, but save screen buffer to database, and share updates with other nodes via global() events, so you can watch others deface...
* message reader/browser
  something akin to mutt's interface would be super.
* bbs-scene.org bbs lister
* demonstrate LORD dosemu game, esp. cp437 art translation!

PARKING LOT

flesh out fileserver ... zIPE's call.
  at least hook on_* methods
  file stats, ftpd admin door, etc.

19:34  airwalk you need 1) gl like ftp support
19:34  airwalk and 2) zipscript-c support
