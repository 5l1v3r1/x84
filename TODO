telnet.py:
  correctly negotiate the following:
    STATUS, TSPEED, LFLOW

message reader/browser
(cheap) message editor
find nvi -S .... nvi still lets you :r /etc/passwd,
  and virus doesn't support unicode ..
  sigh ..

clients acquire and release named locks, w/timeout
  like for dosemu autoexec.bat doors, etc.

support some dosemu game or something with cp437 charset,
ensure it translates correclty..
  and door.py can translate to utf-8 (and vice-versa? for alt+178's?)

something wrong with pipe.send() in getpos()
also snuff getpos() queries from ttyrec !

properly implement STATUS in telnet.py ;/

terminal clients to test against:
  OSX:
   Terminal.app, iTerm2,
  Windows:
   PuTTy
   SyncTerm
   mtel
   telnet (-t vtnt?)
  BSD:
   uxterm + telnet

doc generation
example of using xmodem protocol
'expert' mode goes everywhere, a way to test low-fi terminals ..
groupbase
user editor: overhall
bbs-scene.org bbs lister
flesh out fileserver ... zIPE's call.
  at least hook on_* methods
  file stats, ftpd admin door, etc.
bring weather up to date
pickup/dropoff of global events
? nntp support
? zmodem support

script/ui/menu.py:
     # make new menu
     menu(paraclass)
     # add choices
     choices['c'] = "chat"
     # update and refresh menu
     menu.update(choices)
  - a simple menu class that display's a user menu using
    a readonly paraclass and a high split value by default.
! + menu class takes user input, and listens to broadcast messages
    such as chat invination or new mail and calls gosubs()!
  - get user input like:
     choice = menu.run()
