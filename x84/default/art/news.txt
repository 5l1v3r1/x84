I've been contributing significant terminal fixes and enhancements upstream to the python 'blessings' project. They should become apart of a blessings v1.6 release. With these features, much of the x/84 codebase may be stripped and cleaned up, and several improvements to general readability.

I wrote a pong game, and another "Newton's Nightmare" for keyboard and mouse test input. The mousewheel can be used to move the Pong paddle, and who knows, maybe we'll have 2-player Pong on the BBS soon :-)

x/84 version 1.0.4 has been released to pypi, to install:

   $ |11pip install x84

To upgrade:

   $ |11pip install --upgrade x84

This release improves editing and message reading capabilities. You may have noticed the |10Colors|07, which are safe to use in pager and lightbars. If you need to escape, use another pipe, '||13'. The |14Ansi|07 class now provides an additional method, |14encode_pipe|07, to accompany the previously existing method, |14decode_pipe|07.
